- Figure out how to set working directory to project root in markdown files.
- Set variable types in column metadata so that type can be specified in daisy
- get sensible exploratory plots to look for outliers and correlations
  - try DataExplorer
  - create PDF with histograms and density plots for every variable with data
  - correlation heatmap
  - some way to produce bivariate plots, but not all pairs...
  - boxplots and mosaic plots/ barplots for categorical variables
- setup chunk: restrict to markdown settings, in accordance with markdown conventions
- check how we can all have our own gitignore


Problems.
Data filtering and manipulation
1. What does broad summary in data explorer do?
2. Pearsons correlation doesnt work. 
3. what do other stats tell me? in dataexplorer

Association and clustering
1. How to attribute row names in a tibble or label samples in the phenogram and ordination.
Get pearsons coefficient working

2. importance won't plot on NMDS- - fixed the error you have to run whole chunk or it wont work. 
3. Labels on ordination are whack. 
Do I need to graph stress values for k and pick a value?
4. Does chunk at line 95 edit the phenogram to look better?
How to plot the stress values and choose the best one, which one is the program displaying?
5. I dont understand the Mclust analysis at all. 
6. What is the best metric to report in results to show what characters divide species most strongly?
For example- I would report on the phenetic analysis, ideally with Mclust results, then I could select characters which had the strongest influence on the ordination and plot them as a scatterplot to visualise groupings, then as a box plot(need 6 points to show a half decent spread) to demonstrate alignment with putative species. 
Any point in reporting both phenogram and ordination?
7. Where to store label info for publishable figures? And what kind of labels is best? Match colours with DArTseq, colour coded dots with a legend, that just states OTU groups (probably no population info).
8. Need to decide whether to include ratios or not, and if yes, which of the other measurement to include, probably shouldn't include both?
