- Figure out how to set working directory to project root in markdown files.
- Set variable types in column metadata so that type can be specified in daisy
- get sensible exploratory plots to look for outliers and correlations
  - try DataExplorer
  - create PDF with histograms and density plots for every variable with data
  - correlation heatmap
  - some way to produce bivariate plots, but not all pairs...
  - boxplots and mosaic plots/ barplots for categorical variables
- setup chunk: restrict to markdown settings, in accordance with markdown conventions
- check how we can all have our own gitignore


Problems.
Data filtering and manipulation
1. What does broad summary in data explorer do?
2. Pearsons correlation doesnt work. 
3. what do other stats tell me? in dataexplorer

Association and clustering
1. How to attribute row names in a tibble or label samples in the phenogram and ordination.
2. importance won't plot on NMDS- - fixed the error you have to run whole chunk or it wont work. 
3. Labels on ordination are whack. 
4. I don't know what Rose was doing in the chunk at line 95- maybe trying to edit the phenogram to look better. 
5. I dont understand the Mclust analysis at all.
